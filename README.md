# DisableWinTracking
[GIF of GUI](http://i.imgur.com/AV8btDc.gifv)  
A tool that I created to use some of the known methods of disabling tracking in Windows 10.

## Dependencies
* wxPython
* PyWin32
* Windows 10 (Duh)

## Methods Used
#### Telemetry
Set the "AllowTelemetry" string in "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection" to 0

#### DiagTrack Log
Clears log and disables writing to the log located in "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Diagnosis\ETLLogs\AutoLogger"

#### Services
* Delete: Remove both services
* Disable: Set the "Start" registry key for both services to 4 (Disabled) Located at "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\"

#### HOSTS
Append known tracking domains to the HOSTS file located in "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc"



## How to use
You can either  
A. Install Python and the 2 dependencies and run the script from an elevated (admin) command prompt and select which options you'd like  
B. Run the binary uploaded to the Release tab as an Administrator and select which options you'd like  

## Delete Services vs Disable Services?
Selecting the "Delete" choice will completely delete the tracking services. This is the recommended choice.  
Selecting "Disable" however will simply stop the services from being able to run.
